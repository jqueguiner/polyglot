# gpt-2-simple

![gen_demo](docs/gen_demo.png)

A simple Python package that wraps existing model fine-tuning and generation scripts for [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [GPT-2 text generation model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) (specifically the "small" 124M and "medium" 355M hyperparameter versions). Additionally, this package allows easier generation of text, generating to a file for easy curation, allowing for prefixes to force the text to start with a given phrase.

This package incorporates and makes minimal low-level changes to:

* Model management from OpenAI's [official GPT-2 repo](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) (MIT License)
* Model finetuning from Neil Shepperd's [fork](https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2) of GPT-2 (MIT License)
* Text generation output management from [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) (MIT License / also created by me)

For finetuning, it is **strongly** recommended to use a GPU, although you can generate using a CPU (albeit much more slowly). If you are training in the cloud, using a Colaboratory notebook or a Google Compute Engine VM w/ the [TensorFlow Deep Learning](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/) image is strongly recommended. (as the GPT-2 model is hosted on GCP)

You can use gpt-2-simple to retrain a model using a GPU **for free** in [this Colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce), which also demos additional features of the package.

## Install

gpt-2-simple can be installed [via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gpt_2_simple/):

```shell
pip3 install gpt-2-simple
```

You will also need to install the corresponding TensorFlow for your system (e.g. `tensorflow` or `tensorflow-gpu`). **TensorFlow 2.0 is currently not supported** and the package will throw an assertion if loaded, so TensorFlow 1.14/1.15 is recommended.

## Usage

An example for downloading the model to the local system, fineturning it on a dataset. and generating some text.

Warning: the pretrained 124M model, and thus any finetuned model, is 500 MB! (the pretrained 355M model is 1.5 GB)

```python
import gpt_2_simple as gpt2
import os
import requests

model_name = "124M"
if not os.path.isdir(os.path.join("models", model_name)):
	print(f"Downloading {model_name} model...")
	gpt2.download_gpt2(model_name=model_name)   # model is saved into current directory under /models/124M/


file_name = "shakespeare.txt"
if not os.path.isfile(file_name):
	url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt"
	data = requests.get(url)
	
	with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
		f.write(data.text)
    

sess = gpt2.start_tf_sess()
gpt2.finetune(sess,
              file_name,
              model_name=model_name,
              steps=1000)   # steps is max number of training steps

gpt2.generate(sess)
```

The generated model checkpoints are by default in `/checkpoint/run1`. If you want to load a model from that folder and generate text from it:

```python
import gpt_2_simple as gpt2

sess = gpt2.start_tf_sess()
gpt2.load_gpt2(sess)

gpt2.generate(sess)
```

As with textgenrnn, you can generate and save text for later use (e.g. an API or a bot) by using the `return_as_list` parameter.

```python
single_text = gpt2.generate(sess, return_as_list=True)[0]
print(single_text)
```

You can pass a `run_name` parameter to `finetune` and `load_gpt2` if you want to store/load multiple models in a `checkpoint` folder.

There is also a command-line interface for both finetuning and generation with strong defaults for just running on a Cloud VM w/ GPU. For finetuning (which will also download the model if not present):

```shell
gpt_2_simple finetune shakespeare.txt
```

And for generation, which generates texts to files in a `gen` folder:

```shell
gpt_2_simple generate
```

Most of the same parameters available in the functions are available as CLI arguments, e.g.:

```shell
gpt_2_simple generate --temperature 1.0 --nsamples 20 --batch_size 20 --length 50 --prefix "<|startoftext|>" --truncate "<|endoftext|>" --include_prefix False --nfiles 5
```

See below to see what some of the CLI arguments do.

NB: *Restart the Python session first* if you want to finetune on another dataset or load another model.

## Differences Between gpt-2-simple And Other Text Generation Utilities

The method GPT-2 uses to generate text is slightly different than those like other packages like textgenrnn (specifically, generating the full text sequence purely in the GPU and decoding it later), which cannot easily be fixed without hacking the underlying model code. As a result:

* In general, GPT-2 is better at maintaining context over its entire generation length, making it good for generating conversational text. The text is also generally gramatically correct, with proper capitalization and few typoes.
* The original GPT-2 model was trained on a *very* large variety of sources, allowing the model to incorporate idioms not seen in the input text.
* GPT-2 can only generate a maximum of 1024 tokens per request (about 3-4 paragraphs of English text).
* GPT-2 cannot stop early upon reaching a specific end token. (workaround: pass the `truncate` parameter to a `generate` function to only collect text until a specified end token. You may want to reduce `length` appropriately.)
* Higher temperatures work better (e.g. 0.7 - 1.0) to generate more interesting text, while other frameworks work better between 0.2 - 0.5.
* When finetuning GPT-2, it has no sense of the beginning or end of a document within a larger text. You'll need to use a bespoke character sequence to indicate the beginning and end of a document. Then while generating, you can specify a `prefix` targeting the beginning token sequences, and a `truncate` targeting the end token sequence. You can also set `include_prefix=False` to discard the prefix token while generating (e.g. if it's something unwanted like `<|startoftext|>`).
* If you pass a single-column `.csv` file to `finetune()`, it will automatically parse the CSV into a format ideal for training with GPT-2 (including prepending `<|startoftext|>` and suffixing `<|endoftext|>` to every text document, so the `truncate` tricks above are helpful when generating output). This is necessary to handle both quotes and newlines in each text document correctly.
* GPT-2 allows you to generate texts in parallel by setting a `batch_size` that is divisible into `nsamples`, resulting in much faster generation. Works very well with a GPU (can set `batch_size` up to 20 on Colaboratory's K80)!
* Due to GPT-2's architecture, it scales up nicely with more powerful GPUs. For the 124M model, if you want to train for longer periods of time, GCP's P100 GPU is about 3x faster than a K80/T4 for only 3x the price, making it price-comparable (the V100 is about 1.5x faster than the P100 but about 2x the price). The P100 uses 100% of the GPU even with `batch_size=1`, and about 88% of the V100 GPU.
* If you have a partially-trained GPT-2 model and want to continue finetuning it, you can set `overwrite=True` to finetune, which will continue training and remove the previous iteration of the model without creating a duplicate copy. This can be especially useful for transfer learning (e.g. heavily finetune GPT-2 on one dataset, then finetune on other dataset to get a "merging" of both datasets).
* If your input text dataset is massive (>100 MB), you may want to preencode and compress the dataset using `gpt2.encode_dataset(file_path)`. THe output is a compressed `.npz` file which will load much faster into the GPU for finetuning.
* The 774M "large" model does not currently support finetuning because it will cause modern GPUs to go out-of-memory. However, you can still generate from the default pretrained model using `gpt2.load_gpt2(sess, model_name='774M')` and `gpt2.generate(sess, model_name='774M')`.
* The 1558M "extra large", true model, may not work out-of-the-box with the GPU included with the Colaboratory Notebook. More testing is needed to identify optimial configurations for it.
